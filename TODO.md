* Comment code
* Make state diagrams for everyone and double that it is correct

## Presentation
1. Describe problem - Brad
2. State diagram
    a. Arduino portion - Tyler
        ... Tyler will explain
        ... Nathan will draw
    b. Pi portion - Brad
    c. Website portion - Nathan
3. Demo code
    a. Before we start
        A. ensure all sensors are working
        B. Pi connected to the internet
        C. UART is enabled
        D. Pre log some data
        E. Pull up website before we start
    b. Brad doing the actions and talks through
        A. home, motion, open, close, away
        B. away, open, close, motion, home
        C. Fault tolerance (actions need motion detect)
    c. Go to history on website and show logged info
    d. Say we also open file on pi
